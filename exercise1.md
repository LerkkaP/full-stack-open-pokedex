For an application coded with Java, we can for example use Checkstyle for linting, JUnit for unit testing and Maven for building. Different alternatives to setup the CI besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions are for instance Circle CI, Azure Pipelines, Bitbucket pipelines, AWS CodePipeline and Gitlab CI/CD. Circle CI is an interesting alternative as it offers three types of hosting options: cloud, server and self-hosted solutions. 

There is no definitive answer to the question of whether it would be better to use a self-hosted or cloud-based environment in this case. Self-hosted environments are typically more complex to setup than cloud-based environments, but they do offer more flexibility.  Whether to use cloud-based or self-hosted environment, one should know the scale and the requirements of the project. In this case, where there are 6 people working on the project, I would assume that the project is a medium-sized project; a cloud-based environment would probably be sufficient given that metric. If there would be multiple teams and many projects to work on, setting up a self-hosted environment would probably be more beneficial.
However, more details of the project would be needed in order to conclusively decide which one is better option in this case.
